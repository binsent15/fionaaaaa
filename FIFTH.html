        <hr class="hr1">

        <p class="p1">As you walk into that door coming to me with a beautiful face, i was speechless for a moment to speak to you,
            it was a moment on my head that i was thankful to be with you on that day. I forgot to say thankyouu on that day, and
            giving a lot of time to come and to be with me even though my chikas onti hehe.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="p1">Before i meet you i was so insecured on my looks because i am not that good looking person or guy that 
        not someone who has that elegant look, but in my head "why not i give it a shot?". Also scared on what you think or what will the outcome of our meet up,
        maybe you will talk to me na. Sorry i was so full of insecured on that day i am just hiding it to not feel awkward or shyness.
        A little bit of shyness but i feel like your bestfriend on that day, i found my happiness, comfort person, and someone who can talk to all my rants and problems.
    </p>

    <p class="p1">I will cherish all of these pictures as i want to be your girlfriend (oh chill ka lang, i will wait for you naman i am just saying this on how i feel hehe).
        It kills me to death of happiness when i am looking on our pictures just like super kilig. More meetups to come (aayain talaga kita ng aayain)
        We're gonna make more memories (dapat lang) i want to be the best of the best in this relationship (kung ano man tayo).
